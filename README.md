# Cdocs
A simple contextual help library. Cdocs is intended to help manage files for use in contextual help systems.  Files are Jinja templates containing whatever doc format you prefer. Cdocs applies tokens to the templates, if found. Files can be concationated or composed.  Labels can be stored non-template JSON files.
