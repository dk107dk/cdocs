# when you do a multi-root search the roots are considered in order.
#   this may impact your results. for instance, in the case that you
#   search for /x/y/z+a without allowing split-plus concats.
#   say there is a doc at both locations, but in different roots, and
#   if both roots would be included in the search. one doc will be
#   found, and the order the roots are listed will determine which
#   root is searched first and therefore which doc is found.
